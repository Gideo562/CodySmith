# My Github Pages

Hi my name is Cody Smith and this is my personal website/portfolio repository.

What I do here is update my portfolio with some projects I worked on that peak my interest or 
use to develop my skills to help me become a better data analyst. If you have the time I would 
appreciate it if you could check it out so that you get to know who I am.

Best,

Cody Smith
